# ComfyUI Build and Train Your Network

This is an extension project aimed at customizing neural network layers (such as linear layers, convolutional layers,
etc.) in ComfyUI and providing simplified task training functionality. With this project, you can easily build custom
neural network layers in a graphical manner in ComfyUI and complete training, thereby extending its functionality.

## Features

- âœ¨ **Custom Neural Network Layers**: Users can add and configure custom neural network layers, such as linear layers
  and convolutional layers, within ComfyUI.
- ðŸš€ **Simplified Task Training Functionality**: It offers a streamlined training process.

## Installation

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/linhusyung/comfyui-Build-and-train-your-network.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd comfyui-Build-and-train-your-network
    ```

3. **Modify ComfyUI for gradient calculation**

   In ComfyUI, tensor calculations do not produce gradients. To resolve this issue, you need to modify
   the `ComfyUI/execution.py` file by commenting out `with torch.inference_mode():` and moving all the code within this
   context manager one level forward.

    ```bash
    copy .\replace\execution.py ..\..\execution.py
    ```

   **Note:** Modifying `ComfyUI/execution.py` might cause issues with image generation. If this happens, don't worry;
   you can restore the original state by running the following command:

    ```bash
    copy .\replace\execution1.py ..\..\execution.py
    ```
